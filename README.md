## ⚙️ Data Processing Workflow

1. Loaded CSV data using Pandas
2. Cleaned column names for SQL compatibility
3. Handled missing values (NaN → NULL)
4. Automatically mapped Pandas data types to MySQL data types
5. Created MySQL tables dynamically using Python
6. Inserted data efficiently using bulk insert operations
